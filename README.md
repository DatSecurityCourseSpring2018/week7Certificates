# Week 7 - Certificates under the hood

This week there will be class both Tuesday and Thursday.

The main coding we will be doing is the build a simple https server.

### Readings:
* [This page from Verisign](https://www.verisign.com/en_US/website-presence/website-optimization/ssl-certificates/index.xhtml) gives a good general intro (non-tech) to what certificates are.

* Many of the algorithms we have seen in the Java libraries use the Factory design pattern. [The wikipedia entry "Abstract factory" is the least wrong I found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern)

* What is a certificate in the first place? Wikipedia has two articles we will study in class
	* What is a [Public key certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate)
	* What is the [X.509 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509)

The plan for the two days is that we Tuesday get a simple https server up and running using a selfsigned certicicate. The code for this is in this project.

And the exercise for Thursday is to get the same server running with a real certificate.
